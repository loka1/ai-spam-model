            "a . yes . independence , guardian , and other new pipeline projects were certificated on the basis of negotiated rate contracts . the only restriction is that we need to always offer cost - based recourse rate service as an alternative to negotiated rates . we hope to use negotiated rate agreements for the entire 150 mm of capacity , but we won ' t know until the contracts are executed how much of it will be negotiated rate contracts and how much of it will be under recourse rate contracts . i guess that means that in the cert . app . , we just tell the commission that we will be 100 % at risk and that given the huge interest in the open season , we have no doubts about our ability to sell the full 150 . we should also tell the commission we expect to sell the capacity using negotiated rate contracts or recourse rate contracts or a combination of both .\n",
            "q 2 . can we give prospective customers a \"\" cafeteria style \"\" menu of options ( to steal jeff ' s term ) , like the following :\n",
            "1 . 5 yr . neg . rate deal at a locked in $ . 60 plus fuel and surcharges ( or whatever number we decide on )\n",
            "2 . 10 y . neg . rate deal at a locked in $ . 45 plus fuel and surcharges\n",

            "4 . 15 yr cost based recourse rate plus fuel and surcharges ( importantly this option is not locked in and will float with tw ' s actual rate levels and fuel retainage percentages )\n",
            "a . i think the answer here is \"\" yes . \"\" whatever options we come up with for 1 , 2 , and 3 , we will always have to offer 4 as well . susan and steve stojic : please confirm that we have the right to define specific negotiated rate options and stick to them . otherwise , this negotiated rate approach could get completely unstructured such that we end up with some guys taking our specific options and other guys custom tailoring weird variations ( like a 7 yr , 231 day contract at $ . 51764 , for example ) . i ' m not sure that would be a bad thing , but we need to think about it . we need to be sure we can tell a customer \"\" no \"\" and make it stick if he tries to mix and match by asking for the 5 yr term and the $ . 35 rate , for example . i think we can lay out options of our choosing and then enforce a \"\" no substitutions \"\" policy ( this is sticking with the \"\" cafeteria \"\" theme ) but we need to be sure .\n",
            "q . 3 . if we can use the \"\" cafeteria options \"\" approach , how much flexibility do we have in structuring the options ?\n",
            "a : this one is hard . we need to be sure that the price and term we choose to offer for options 1 - 3 is solely within our discretion . we don ' t want to be second guessed by ferc as to whether we should have offered option 1 at $ . 58 instead of $ . 60 . susan and steve : if you guys confirm that we have discretion in how to structure our negotiated rate options , does that mean we can slant the economics of the negotiated rate options so they are a better deal than the recourse option ( for most shippers ) ? i . e . , could we deliberately incent shippers to sign on for the short term deals - - i . e . , by offering options 1 - 3 at $ . 55 , $ . 45 and $ . 40 instead of the $ . 60 , $ . 45 , and $ . 35 shown above . i suspect that is what guardian and the other pipes did to obtain 100 % subscription under neg . rate deals .\n",
            "q . 4 . how do we allocate capacity to customers if demand exceeds supply ? ? ?\n",
            "a . ideally , we ' d be able to allocate the 150 to the guys who want to buy it the way we ' d prefer to sell it . under the above example , assuming stan , danny and steve decide short term deals are better , what if we get 100 mm / d of offers on each of the 4 rate / term options described above . that ' s 400 mm / d of demand for a 150 mm / d project . can we sell 100 to the guys who want option 1 ( $ . 60 / 5 yrs ) and the remaining 50 to the 10 yr / $ . 45 guys ? that really hoses the recourse bidders . do we have to cover the recourse demand first and then allocate the remaining capacity pro rata to everyone else ? pro rata to everyone ? under the rule that negotiated rate bids have to be deemed to be at max rate for purposes of allocation , pro rata to everyone may be the right answer . or at least its the answer until we ' ve filled the recourse rate guys ' orders , then we can give the remaining capacity to the neg . rate guys whose bids we value most highly ( using some objective nondiscriminatory calculation of course ) . ugh .\n",

            "on nov . 15 , 2000 , kern filed an application to expand its system and provide 74 , 500 dth / d of additional delivery point capacity at wheeler ridge into socal gas . but firm shippers claim recent data provided by kern and socal gas indicates kern river already has sold more than the 450 mmcf / d of firm delivery point capacity it has available into wheeler ridge . firm shippers told ferc . kern river has sold 468 . 4 mmcf / d of capacity at wheeler ridge .\n",
            "not true , says lynn dahlberg , kern ' s manager of marketing . \"\" we have to date subscribed at 450 , 000 dth / d . and unless we subscribe at more than 830 , 000 dth / d , we have not sold more capacity than socal has takeaway . \"\" the combined kern - mojave lines can deliver on a firm basis 600 , 000 dth / d , with kern having 450 , 00 and mojave 150 , 000 . \"\" we can move more than that capacity , and we have , \"\" she added .\n",
            "socal gas has noted that it curtails nominations from kern on a regular basis , shippers said . with the proposed expansion project , kern will be \"\" creating the same type of firm delivery point over - sale situation that the commission found to be unjust and unreasonable on el paso natural gas at el paso ' s socal gas / topock delivery point , \"\" they added . while they support the expansion , they do not want to see their firm delivery rights in southern california degraded . they also complained that kern ' s marketing affiliate is one of the primary beneficiaries of the proposed additional access to wheeler ridge .\n",
            "dahlberg conceded that other interstate lines also deliver to the wheeler ridge point , but \"\" adding more players to wheeler gives markets on socal more supply options . shippers have to compete . \"\"\n",
            "the shippers are concerned , however that \"\" substantial benefits under the currently structured proposal accrue primarily to kern river and its affiliate and would restrict the firm rights of existing shippers . . . . \"\" the commission should prohibit kern from selling additional firm rights at wheeler ridge , or provide only rights to secondary and tertiary capacity [ emphasis added ] that is of a lower priority than the rights of existing firm customers , they said .\",ham,2001-03-21\n",

            "early last year , the el paso natural gas company took bids from two dozen companies for the right to ship enough natural gas through its pipeline from texas and new mexico to meet one - sixth of the daily demand of energy - starved california .\n",
            "the winner : el paso ' s sister company , the el paso merchant energy company , which buys , sells and trades natural gas . the bidding was not close . el paso merchant offered twice as much for the capacity as the other companies bid , in total , for bits and pieces .\n",
            "why pay so much more ? california officials , who are pressing a complaint against el paso at the federal energy regulatory commission , say the answer is simple . the state contends that el paso merchant , with help from its sister company , saw the transaction as a way to manipulate the price of natural gas by using its control of pipeline capacity .\n",
            "according to sealed documents obtained by the new york times that are part of filings in the federal case , executives at el paso merchant said internally that the deal would give them ' ' more control ' ' of gas markets , including the ' ' ability to influence the physical market ' ' to benefit the company ' s financial positions .\n",
            "el paso executives called the accusations fanciful , and in a formal response to california ' s complaint , said the state ' ' grossly distorted ' ' company documents by quoting words and phrases out of context .\n",
            "the dispute opens a window on an important debate about oversight of the natural gas industry , which fuels a growing share of the nation ' s electric power plants .\n",
            "at issue is whether current safeguards do enough to prevent anticompetitive abuses in the marketing and trading of natural gas , and whether federal regulators adequately enforce existing rules . in particular , many industry officials question whether regulated pipeline companies are able to favor unregulated sister companies that trade natural gas and are free to maximize profits .\n",
            "more than 200 , 000 miles of interstate pipelines crisscross the country , moving natural gas from canada , the southwest and other producing regions to fuel factories , power utilities and heat houses .\n",
            "not long ago , many parts of the country had excess pipeline capacity . but experts say that several regions , including california , new york and new england , now face constraints as demand soars for gas to fuel power plants .\n",
            "in california , state officials and utility executives said the documents in the federal case , and el paso ' s actions , were proof that the state ' s energy crisis stemmed not just from an ill - conceived deregulation plan but from price manipulation and profiteering .\n",
            "' ' they are the market maker with this pipeline , ' ' said loretta lynch , the president of the california public utilities commission , which has struggled to cope with skyrocketing power prices and supply shortages .\n",
            "el paso ' ' sets the price in california , ' ' ms . lynch said , and what it did was intentional . ' ' it has affected the price , ' ' she said , ' ' for everything related to heat and electrical power prices in the state . ' '\n",
            "california ' s complaint to the federal agency contends that el paso merchant ' ' has hoarded capacity and refused to attractively price unused capacity ' ' on the pipeline . the state also charges that el paso natural gas , the pipeline ' s owner , has had no incentive to spur competition , by offering discounts to other users , because the two companies are corporate siblings . the state said that el paso had violated federal natural gas statutes that prohibit anticompetitive behavior .\n",
            "the sealed filings in the el paso case indicated that the company expected to make money by widening the ' ' basis spread ' ' - - the difference between what gas can be bought for in producing basins of texas and new mexico , at one end of the pipeline , and its price on delivery to southern california .\n",
            "as it turned out , spreads widened enormously over the last year as the price of gas soared in california , adding to costs for wholesale electricity that pushed the biggest utilities near bankruptcy . california utilities paid $ 6 . 2 billion above competitive prices for wholesale electricity over the last 10 months , state officials estimated . the utilities are not allowed to recoup the costs from customers . while the cost of 1 , 000 cubic feet of gas typically is less than $ 1 higher at the california end of the pipeline , spot prices in the state rose to almost $ 50 more than the texas - new mexico price in december .\n",
            "to executives of the parent company , the el paso corporation , the accusations of market manipulation are ludicrous .\n",
            "high gas prices in california , el paso executives said in interviews , are easily explained by soaring demand , the poor credit standing of the state ' s utilities and the failure of the utilities to retain pipeline capacity or store enough gas for winter .\n",
            "' ' the idea that anybody is holding back on california is really ridiculous , ' ' said clark c . smith , president of el paso merchant ' s operations in north america .\n",
            "some el paso customers , though , agreed with california officials . the pacific gas this year , it is expected to have $ 700 million in north america alone . in its latest quarterly report , el paso attributed those profits , in part , to ' ' commodity market and trading margins ' ' that were enhanced by ' ' power price volatility , particularly in the western united states . ' '\n",
            "critics contend that el paso set out to exploit those conditions . according to the sealed filings , on feb . 14 , 2000 , the day before el paso merchant was awarded the pipeline capacity , executives made a presentation to william a . wise , chief executive of the parent company , laying out the rationale for the bid .\n",
            "the presentation outlined what it termed ' ' strategic advantages , ' ' including ' ' more control of total physical markets ' ' and the ' ' ability to influence the physical market to the benefit of any financial / hedge position , ' ' according to the sealed filings . the passages suggested that el paso expected the deal to give it sway over the market for trading actual volumes of gas and to support financial transactions it had entered into with other parties to limit its risk .\n",
            "for every one - cent increase in the spread on gas prices , the presentation said , el paso merchant stood to make an additional $ 2 . 4 million .\n",
            "under the heading ' ' challenges , ' ' according to the sealed filings , the presentation stated that storage was needed ' ' to help manipulate physical spreads , adding to the overall transport / storage cost . ' '\n",
            "on april 14 , according to the sealed filings , el paso merchant ' s president at the time , greg g . jenkins , wrote a memorandum to mr . wise involving an update for directors meeting later that month . the memorandum stated : ' ' we will make money two ways : 1 ) increase the load factor , 2 ) widen the basis spread . ' '\n",
            "the language appears to suggest that el paso merchant would profit by increasing the gas flow in the pipeline - - the load factor - - while increasing the difference between what gas could be bought for at one end and what it could be sold for at the other end - - the basis spread .\n",
            "in an interview , mr . smith , the el paso merchant executive , said that the unit ' s prices , and profits , on bulk gas sales in california were locked in months in advance , so that the company could not benefit from rising prices in the spot market .\n",
            "otherwise , mr . smith declined to provide any details about money made on the pipeline deal or about financial terms of the transactions that locked in prices ahead of time . in addition , mr . smith said that nearly all of el paso merchant ' s pipeline capacity was used every day when prices spiked late last year , with no capacity withheld to increase prices .\n",
            "the company did not respond last week to a request to discuss information in the sealed documents . but el paso merchant , in a filing with federal regulators , said california ' s complaint had ' ' misconstrued and incorrectly interpreted ' ' what it termed ' ' snippets of data .

            "28625,re : capacity posting procedures,\"pursuant to our meeting , i was to check the posting timelines to see if we could make the 1 day category , include 5 months or less rather than less than 5 months . based on a recent decision ( march 16 , 2001 ) in columbia gas transmission co , i think we can . in columbia , the commission approved columbia ' s proposal to establish an interactive auction process in which firm capacity available for less than one year would be posted for an initial one hour period from 7 : 00 am to 8 : 00 a . m . capacity offered for one year or more would be subject to an initial posting period of 5 days . this indicates movement by the commission to much shorter posting periods for capacity available for less than one year . i think we can modify our procedures to include up to 5 months in the 1 day posting category . however , we may want to consider combining the 3 day category and 1 day category into one 1 day category for capacity offered for less than one year . in addition , for capacity offered for one year or more , columbia will advertise a proposed offer on its ebb one day prior to the five - day posting of the capacity . ( this supports a special posting in advance . ) although it is good to have these internal procedures , what is important to the commission is that pipeline tariffs set forth specific procedures regarding the availability of capacity .\n",
            "the columbia order also gave guidance on when a pipeline has to accept a bid for max rates . columbia proposed that it not be required to sell capacity to shippers bidding the maximum rate for a term of less than 12 months until one day prior to the commencement of gas flow detailed in the auction package . the commission rejected this in favor of the industrials ' proposal : beginning 30 days before the capacity is available for service , columbia must accept bids at the max rate for a term of five months to less than 12 months . beginning seven days before the capacity is available , columbia must accept maximum rate bids for terms of more than one month to less tha 5 months . columbia must accept maximum rate bids for a term of one month or less one day before gas flows .\n",

            "the graph clearly shows that as the pressure and temperatures move further into the envelope the more liquids will be produced . that explains why more liquids are produced by pigging sections between cs p - 2 and cs p - 3 . furthermore , using the process model used to generate the phase envelope , the model indicates that gas at 800 psig and 65 degf would exist in both vapor and liquid phases . using a flow rate of 100 mmcfd the liquid phase fraction would be approximately 80 bbls . per day that could amount to approximately 2400 bbls . per month . this liquid volume compares closely to some of the recovery volumes reported by randy and walt below .\n",

            "the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas . this point feeds some domestic customers . we don ' t want condensate getting into this point .\n",
            "there is a customer on this line ( owens - corning ) who gets fuel from us . their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes . at any given time , i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production . if they lose fuel , the product is lost and we could be liable . i am also told that once the plant goes down , it could take a long time ( even weeks ) to get it back up .\n",
            "the owens - corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel . when the line has large amounts of condensate , we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point . this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure . the gas from energas is not measured . they used to have the contract , but when we got it , they removed their meter setting . apparently they agreed ( verbally ) to supply gas to the plant in march , for a few hours , when a pig was run . the plant uses about 3 mmcf / d and energas was on for about 3 hours . i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel . . . . . $ 21 , 000 ! obviously we will negotiate that amount , but they have us at a disadvantage . i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours .\n",
            "everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule , we would not get large condensate amounts into p - 3 ( which shuts us down , by the way ) , we would not have to use energas , we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point , and we would not incur the overtime when this happens .\n",

            "i have talked with ( agave ) the producer about this and we ' re working together to try and figure out what ' s going on . we can pick up water on our instruments but there ' s not anything that we know of that will show condensate . this has to be carrying through in the gas because there ' s not a large amount of liquids at the delivery point . the best solution at this time is to get enough gas to pig the line more often . after getting the liquid in at p - 3 we ran a pig from roswell to p - 1 and it came in dry . as soon as the volumes come up we ' ll run from p - 1 to p - 2 then into p - 3 . thanks for everyone ' s help in this . if we need a conference call to discuss let me know .\n",

            "gary , we recently had to run a pig from p - 2 to p - 3 in order to push about 2200 barrels of condensate out of the line . we had started developing problems with some deliveries off that line . apparently , in order to run a pig , some volume has to be routed to that line . i understand that there are some marketing and gas control issues when we do this , but here are some operational concerns when we have to put this off or postpone it :\n",
            "the condensate and fluids tend to build up to the point that they carry over to a delivery point with energas . this point feeds some domestic customers . we don ' t want condensate getting into this point .\n",
            "there is a customer on this line ( owens - corning ) who gets fuel from us . their process is very sensitive to pressure and volume changes . at any given time , i am told that they have about a million dollars worth of material in production . if they lose fuel , the product is lost and we could be liable . i am also told that once the plant goes down , it could take a long time ( even weeks ) to get it back up .\n",
            "the owens - corning plant does not have an agreement with anyone for alternate fuel . when the line has large amounts of condensate , we have been asking energas to supply the plant until the pig passes the point . this is in order to prevent a slug of liquid from affecting the fuel pressure . the gas from energas is not measured . they used to have the contract , but when we got it , they removed their meter setting . apparently they agreed ( verbally ) to supply gas to the plant in march , for a few hours , when a pig was run . the plant uses about 3 mmcf / d and energas was on for about 3 hours . i was notified today that energas sent us a bill for the march pig run when we used their gas for fuel . . . . . $ 21 , 000 ! obviously we will negotiate that amount , but they have us at a disadvantage . i can only assume that we will receive a similar bill for using them last weekend for about 3 hours .\n",
            "everyone feels that if we run a pig on a regular schedule , we would not get large condensate amounts into p - 3 ( which shuts us down , by the way ) , we would not have to use energas , we would not risk pushing condensate into a delivery point , and we would not incur the overtime when this happens .\n",

            "subject : negotiated rates\n",
            "pursuant to our conversation yesterday , here are some guidelines for the northern marketers to follow when doing above - maximum rate negotiated rate transactions .\n",
            "the commission permits a pipeline to charge above - maximum rates under negotiated rate authority provided that the capacity also remains available at the maximum recourse rate . in other words , we cannot unilaterally require a customer to purchase capacity at a rate above the max rate ; however , customers may willingly choose to pay a negotiated rate ( above max rates or below minimum rates ) .\n",
            "below are some faqs and the appropriate response when negotiating rates with customers in an above - maximum rate environment .\n",
            "1 . is it better to use a fixed rate or an index / formula based rate ? it is better to use an index or formula based negotiated rate as opposed to a fixed rate , as the index or formula - based rates provide a reasonable basis as to why a customer would enter into a negotiated rate transaction exceeding max rates , e . g . to accommodate the customer ' s risk profile .\n",
            "2 . who should propose the rate ? it is better for the customer to propose the rate . you may ask questions like : have you seen the spread ? what do you think ? what can you give me for the subject capacity ? will you split the upside ? if so , what is a fair split ? the goal here is to have the customer come up with the rate . if the customer won ' t go there , it is never appropriate to bully , cajole , or use undue pressure to get an above - maximum rate deal . moreover , we can never imply or otherwise indicate that the capacity is unavailable if the customer does not pay a negotiated rate or above - maximum rate .\n",
            "3 . do i have to offer the maximum rate or say this capacity is also available at the maximum rate ? our capacity is always offered at the maximum tariff rate because that is the rate on file which the shipper sees when he / she looks at our tariff . we don ' t have to expressly state the capacity is available at our maximum recourse rate , but if the customer requests to pay the maximum rate , no further conversations about paying a negotiated rate should take place . in other words , we have to sell available capacity at the maximum rate once a shipper asks for that rate unless we are negotiating a longer term maximum rate deal for such capacity at the same time . in such circumstances , please confer with regulatory and legal so that we can determine what action is appropriate to take given the specific facts .\n",
            "4 . can a shipper get a higher priority by paying more than the maximum rate ? no . shippers willing to pay more than the maximum recourse rate are considered to have paid the maximum recourse rate for capacity allocation and priority purposes . a shipper willing to pay only the recourse rate cannot lose access to capacity merely because someone else is willing to pay a negotiated rate . where there are more requests for capacity than there is capacity available , the pipeline must allocate capacity among those shippers willing to pay either the negotiated rate or the maximum recourse rate on the allocation basis required by the tariff .\n",
            "given that customers have recorded phone lines , be careful what you say . we cannot deny the availability of capacity at the recourse rate , nor can we mislead customers into believing that the maximum rate is unavailable for certain capacity for any reason .\",ham,2001-06-21\n",
